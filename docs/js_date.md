# Date Object
##### setInterval

The setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds).
It will continue calling the function until clearInterval() is called or the window is closed.

``` js
function myAlert()[
     	alert("HI");
}
setInterval(myAlert, 3000);
```

This will call the myAlert function every 3 seconds (1000 ms = 1 second).
Write the name of the function without parentheses when passing it into the setInterval method.

The Date object enables us to work with dates.
A date consists of a year, a month, a day, an hour, a minute, a second, and milliseconds.

Using new Date(), create a new date object with the current date and time

``` js
var d = new Date();
//d stores the current date and time
```


The other ways to initialize dates allow for the creation of new date objects from the specified date and time

- new Date(milliseconds)
- new Date(dateString)
- new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)


JavaScript dates are calculated in milliseconds from 01 January, 1970 00:00:00 Universal Time (UTC). One day contains 86,400,000 millisecond.
For example:

``` js
//Fri Jan 02 1970 00:00:00
var d1 = new Date(86400000); 

//Fri Jan 02 2015 10:42:00
var d2 = new Date("January 2, 2015 10:42:00");

//Sat Jun 11 1988 11:42:00
var d3 = new Date(88,5,11,11,42,0,0);
```

JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0, and December is 11.
Date objects are static, rather than dynamic. The computer time is ticking, but date objects don't change, once created.
When a Date object is created, a number of methods make it possible to perform operations on it. getMonth(), getDate(), getDay(),etcâ€¦

``` js
var d = new Date();
var hours= d.getHours();
//hours equals to the current hour
```
