# JavaScript Mastery

JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps or an experienced coder looking to sharpen your skills, this website will guide you through the world of JavaScript. JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
